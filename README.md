FaaStener is an open source selection support system intended to simplify browsing and filtering Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) platforms.
It is build using Angular and Angular Material and provides a graphical user interface for interacting with the platformâ€™s data collected using the classification framework introduced in [this research publication](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0164121221000030).
Using FaaStener, one can perform multi-attribute search for suitable FaaS platform based on the specified requirements and to visualize the corresponding results.
